Choose Your Own Adventur (in Learning) Program
by LISA BAERGA

## General Overview
<br>
The Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Project (CYOAP) is an end-of-course project where students willâ€¦
Learn new content on their own
Apply the content they learn each day to their own programs
Engage in reflection on their learning in a blog designed to document their processes
Present their final product and process to their peers


## Motivation for Unit
After the AP Exam, students in an AP CSP (or AP CS A) class often lose motivation. At this point
in the year, students have already 'finished' the curriculum for the AP Exam and have taken the
Exam itself. However, because we, in NY, take the exam significantly earlier in our academic years
than other states, we usually wind up with approximately a month of time *after* the summative exam
has been taken, but before the school year ends. This is too much time to do more traditional end-of-year light-weight activities. Therefore, this project is designed to engage students during this time, as well as to help them to add to their portfolio of projects.

## Standards Referenced
The standards referenced here are the State of New York's newly adopted [standards for high school](http://www.nysed.gov/common/nysed/files/programs/curriculum-instruction/computer-science-digital-fluency-standards-9-12.pdf).
Specifically, the standards addressed in this unit are:

### Digital Literacy
9-12.DL.2 Communicate and work collaboratively with others using digital tools to support individual learning and contribute to the learning of others. 

### Computational Thinking
9-12.CT.8 Develop a program that effectively uses control structures in order to create a computer program for practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue. 

9-12.CT.9 Systematically test and refine programs using a range of test cases, based on anticipating common errors and user behavior.

9-12.CT.10 Collaboratively design and develop a program or computational artifact for a specific audience and create documentation outlining implementation features to inform collaborators and users.

## Tools Used
The tools used for this project are:
[github.com](https://github.com/) to provide version control and to house the final project and provide a location for students' documentation and blog.
[repl.it](https://repl.it/) or some other IDE, such as cloud9, atom, etc.
Program Language(s) used for this project will vary from student to student, but must be approved by the teacher.

## Resources
Suggested areas to learn languages include:

### W3 Schools: 
[Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)
[Java](https://www.w3schools.com/js/DEFAULT.asp)
[JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/DEFAULT.asp)
[Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)

## Lessons
Total length: 4 - ?? Weeks (This is a flexible unit timewise, which can be lengthened to provide students more time to learn and to create more in-depth projects.)



## Assesments
The final project is itself the assessment, and is comprised of 3 components:
**The Blog**, which documents students' process and learning throughout the unit, and which is
the most important part of the project, because it documents what actions students took
learn, what they learned from those actions, and what development tasks students performed
each day, as they worked to implement what they learned into their program,
**The Program**, the parameters of which are open-ended to allow students choice, and
**The Presentation**, the last portion of the project, which requires students to present their
work and learing to their peers in some way.
