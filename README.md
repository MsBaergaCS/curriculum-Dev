UNIT PLAN NAME
by LISA BAERGA

## General Overview
<br>
The Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Project (CYOAP) is an end-of-course project where students willâ€¦
Learn new content on their own
Apply the content they learn each day to their own programs
Engage in reflection on their learning in a blog designed to document their processes
Present their final product and process to their peers


## Motivation for Unit
After the AP Exam, students in an AP CSP (or AP CS A) class often lose motivation. At this point
in the year, students have already 'finished' the curriculum for the AP Exam and have taken the
Exam itself. However, because we, in NY, take the exam significantly earlier in our academic years
than other states, we usually wind up with approximately a month of time *after* the summative exam
has been taken, but before the school year ends. This is too much time to do more traditional end-of-year light-weight activities. Therefore, this project is designed to engage students during this time, as well as to help them to add to their portfolio of projects.

## Standards Referenced
The standards referenced here are the State of New York's newly adopted standards.
Specifically, the standards addressed in this unit are:

### Digital Literacy
9-12.DL.2 Communicate and work collaboratively with others using digital tools to support individual learning and contribute to the learning of others.

9-12.CT.8 Develop a program that effectively uses control structures in order to create a computer program for practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue. 

9-12.CT.9 Systematically test and refine programs using a range of test cases, based on anticipating common errors and user behavior.

9-12.CT.10 Collaboratively design and develop a program or computational artifact for a specific audience and create documentation outlining implementation features to inform collaborators and users.
