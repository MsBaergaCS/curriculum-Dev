# Final Research Project: Choose Your Own Adventure (in Learning): Exploring Programming Languages 

## Overview
Throughout this year, you have had some brief introduction to a number of different coding languages (some more than others). <br>
We have often discussed how there are often many different yet equally valid ways to solve a problem. <br>
For this reason, there are many different  yet equally valid coding languages. Some may have been designed <br>
to complete very specific tasks. Others (like Snap!) are considered general-purpose languages. This project will <br>
be your opportunity to select a coding language of your choice and explore it in more depth.<br>

### Your Task
Together with at least one partner, you will select a language (HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Python, Java, etc.).<br>
Using online and/or print resources, research lessons, tutorials, and one another to **teach yourselves** <br>
to code in your selected language. 

Once you are familiar with the basics of your selected language, use your new-found understanding to code a <br>
program addressing a problem or issue of your choosing. Your program should demonstrate the capabilities of <br>
and utilize multiple different features of the selected coding language that, when combined, produce a result<br> 
that cannot be easily accomplished without the use of computing tools and techniques. You will document the <br>
process you take to do this, making note of progess, revisions and any setbacks along the way. You will also use<br> 
your understanding of the language to create a Dictionary/Glossary of your language that not only “translates” <br>
it but also compares it to Snap! 

Finally, you will create and deliver an interactive presentation for your peers that will effectively inform them <br>
of both your coding language generally and your program specifically. <br>

You will be graded on four main components: <br> 
Into-Snap Translation/Dictionary <br>
Program/Code 
Presentation
Ongoing Documentation/Blog

See calendar for more specific information on due dates.

### Your Documentation Should: 
Include an entry for each day you worked on your program. 
Identify the what you got done, or worked on, each day. If someone wondered what order you developed the program in, they could understand that and follow it. 
Identify and explain code you wrote and/or what you learned that day. 
### Your Translation/Dictionary Should:
Identify 4 or 5 different concepts in your new language. 
Explain what the code does. 
“Translate” it into Snap - take a screenshot or export the block(s) that is the most similar to it.
Compare your selected conept to a familiar coding language (such as Snap!), highlighting any similarities and/or differences.
### Your Program/Code Should:
Be your own code. While you can elicit the help of peers and may make use of tutorials to learn how to code, the program you have written should be your own. Everyone is submitting their own program/code.
Use specific features of the language to implement algorithms and abstractions.
Address a problem or issue of your choosing. 
Be something that cannot be easily accomplished without the use of computing tools and techniques.
### Your Presentation Should:
Provide background information on the purpose, function, origin, and/or development of the coding language. 2alex
Identify the common uses and/or users of the coding language. 
Compare your selected language to a familiar coding language (Snap!), highlighting both similarities and differences.  
Guide your audience through a brief tutorial that will give them the tools to code a simple program of their own.
Present your own code, describing how you used specific features of the language to implement algorithms and/or abstractions.alex
